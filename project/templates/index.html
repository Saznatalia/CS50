    <h2 style="text-align: left">RULES OF BLOCK DIET</h2>

    <div class="index-text">
        A block diet has a similar background as The Zone DietÂ® developed by Dr. Barry Sears.
        It encourages you to balance your nutrition in a caloric ratio of 30%-40%-30% (protein - carbohydrates - fats).
        The food block will always consist of protein, carbohydrate and fat of your choice.
        More information in <a href="/blocks">Food Blocks</a>.
    </div>
    <div class="index-text">
        <ul>
            <li>The number of food blocks you should eat per day - 9! No more or less!</li>
            <li>Start your day with a glass of water with 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar or lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Drink at least 2 liters of pure water daily.</li>
