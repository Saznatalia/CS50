    The scientific term for body fat is "adipose tissue." Adipose tissue serves a number of important functions.
    Its primary purpose is to store lipids from which the body creates energy. In addition, it secretes a number
    of important hormones, and provides the body with some cushioning as well as insulation. <br/>
    Body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is a base level of fat that is
    found in most parts of the body. It is necessary fat that maintains life and reproductive functions. The amount
    of essential fat differs between men and women, and is typically around 2-5% in men, and 10-13% in women.
    The healthy range of body fat for men is typically defined as 8-19%, while the healthy range for women is 21-33%.
    <br/>
    Storage fat is fat that accumulates in adipose tissue, be it subcutaneous fat (deep under the dermis and wrapped
    around vital organs) or visceral fat (fat located inside the abdominal cavity, between organs), and references to
    body fat typically refer to this type of fat. While some storage fat is ideal, excess amounts of storage fat can
    have serious negative health implications. <br/>
    Excess body fat leads to the condition of being overweight and eventually to obesity given that insufficient measures
    are taken to curb increasing body fat. Note that being overweight does not necessarily indicate an excess of body fat.
    A person's body weight is comprised of multiple factors including (but not limited to) body fat, muscle, bone density,
    and water content. Thus, highly muscular people are often classified as overweight. <br/>
    There are many specific techniques used for measuring body fat. The calculator above uses a method involving equations
    developed at the Naval Health Research Center by Hodgdon and Beckett in 1984. The method for measuring the relevant
    body parts as well as the specific equations used are provided below: <br/>
    <li>Measure the circumference of the subject's waist at a horizontal level around the navel for men, and at the level with
    the smallest width for women. Ensure that the subject does not pull their stomach inwards to obtain accurate
    measurements. </li>
    <li>Measure the circumference of the subject's neck starting below the larynx, with the tape sloping downward to the front.
    The subject should avoid flaring their neck outwards.</li>
    <li>For women only: Measure the circumference of the subject's hips at the largest horizontal measure.</li>
    Once these measurements are obtained, use the following formulas to calculate an estimate of body fat: <br/>
    Males: BFP = (495/(1.0324 - 0.19077ﾃ様og10(waist-neck) ) + 0.15456ﾃ様og10(height)) - 450 <br/>
    Female: BFP = (495/1.29579 - 0.35004ﾃ様og10(waist+hip-neck) + 0.22100ﾃ様og10(height)) - 450<br/>
    Note that results of these calculations are only an estimate since they are based on many different assumptions to make
    them as applicable to as many people as possible. For more accurate measurements of body fat, the use of instruments such
    as bioelectric impedance analysis or hydrostatic density testing is necessary.
